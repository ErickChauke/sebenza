# Sprint 1 — timetable

## Goal
A fully working timetable showing your real uni and work schedule. Recurring weekly events and one-off events. Add, edit, delete from the UI.

## Branch
`sprint-1`

## Done when
- Your real university lectures and work shifts are visible in a week view.
- You can add, edit, and delete events from the UI.
- The seed script populates your timetable from a single file.
- Deployed and working on phone.

## Layer 1 — schema
Add to `prisma/schema.prisma`:
```prisma
model TimetableEvent {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId      String
  title       String
  type        String
  color       String   @default("#378ADD")
  dayOfWeek   Int?
  startTime   String
  endTime     String
  isRecurring Boolean  @default(true)
  specificDate DateTime?
  location    String?
  notes       String?
  user        User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
}
```
Run: `npx prisma migrate dev --name add-timetable`
Commit: `"add timetable schema"`

## Layer 2 — server actions
Create `src/actions/timetable.ts` with:
- `getEvents()` — fetch all events for the current user
- `createEvent(data)` — create a new event, validate with Zod
- `updateEvent(id, data)` — update an existing event
- `deleteEvent(id)` — delete an event

Create `scripts/update-timetable.ts` — a standalone script that clears all existing events for the user and re-inserts from a hardcoded array. Edit this file each semester.
Commit: `"add timetable server actions and seed script"`

## Layer 3 — UI
- `src/app/(app)/timetable/page.tsx` — timetable page (server component, fetches events)
- `src/components/modules/timetable/week-view.tsx` — 7-column week grid, events rendered as colored cards
- `src/components/modules/timetable/event-card.tsx` — individual event card (title, time, location)
- `src/components/modules/timetable/event-modal.tsx` — shadcn Dialog for add/edit form
- Add "Timetable" link to the sidebar
Commit: `"add timetable UI components"`

## Layer 4 — deploy
- Run `npx tsx scripts/update-timetable.ts` to seed your real schedule.
- Push, deploy, confirm on phone.
- Merge to main.
